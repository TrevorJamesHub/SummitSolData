Data Analysis of Summit Sol's class attendance

Sections are broken down with different forms of analysis and totaling that was not avaialble to the manager of Summit Sol. These figures were able to provide insights into trends of class attendance and assist the formulation of future class schedules and event offerings. 

Please do not hesitate to ask any questions related to the data, this is one of my first larger data-based projects working with Python and Pandas. I am no expert however, my analysis comes from a data-driven approach, as well as experience from managing a studio myself.
